# ToDoGether Style Guide

## About the project

The web application [ToDoGether](https://todogether.projects.multimediatechnology.at/) was created during a project week at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences (German: [Fachhochschule Salzburg](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/)). The students Bernhard Schmidhuber and Josef Markus Mitterbauer, both created the web application in compliance with this style guide.

## Why another task managing application?

All the applications where you were able to manage work for a team had a simple limitation: one task on the board has exactly one status for everyone in the team. So after a task was set to done it was done for the whole team.

As we used to list/manage our tasks on an university installation of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/) we've found out that this helps, but still everyone want's to keep track of their tasks separately. So why don't create an application that let's us manage the todos together but everyone can keep track on the status on their own? That's the gap that ToDoGether is about to fill.

## Purpose of the style guide

Creating this styleguide helps us maintain the same look and feel throughout the application we want to develop and (maybe in the future, when the code will be open-source) it should help others to apply to our styles.
