#### Class Naming

For the class names we use a self-written functional approach of a methodology, because it is the easiest and most comfortable way for our small project.

Our class names match their usage, e.g. the task element is called "task", it's due date "duedate", and so on.

If we need additional information, e.g. the current status of the task, then we use `class="task todo"`.
