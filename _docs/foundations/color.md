A variety of colors was used to style different elements. We diveded them into three groups in the style guide: primary colors, background colors and task colors. When using this colors please take care of the contrast between those colors, so the content on the webpage still can be read.

<!-- Selbiges wie beim Branding, bekommen wir den Text vielleicht direkt rein in die Elemente? -->

The primary color (#24A) can be referenced as the theme color. It is used for the branding on the logo, hero image and as background color for the menu. The other primary colors, black and white, are being used for texts (as foreground color) on the different elements.

The background colors are used as the colors for the main background of the "board", the background of the "tasks cards" themselves and the buttons used in the menu and on the various sites.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/color/background-colors.html' %}

The task state colors are supposed to show the different states throughout the app. The todo state color aligns with the theme color whereas doing and done are trying to have a certain contrast to each.
